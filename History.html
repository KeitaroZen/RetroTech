	<h2>Bonus PS1 Fact</h2>
						<p>
						With the transition from 2D pixel games from the late 80s to early 90s, the PS1 was home for 3D games. Due to this, the playstation one controller needed a redesign.
						The playstation one controller is called the Duelshock. When the console first released, the duelshock controller was flat. With the d-pad buttons on left side used to 
						move characters across the screen in 2D games. Designer Teiyu Goto thought 3D environments world require 3D controllers. He gave the Dualshock two angled grips, shoulder buttons, 
						and a second analog stick to control the camera.

	<h2>Bonus Gamecube Fact</h2>
						<p>
				    A criticism that the Gamecube recieved was the lack of a DVD player. In the earlier 2000s, Sony Playstation 2 and Microsoft Xbox allowed
            DVDs to play on home tvs. This increase sales numbers for Sony and Microsoft because it was a cheaper deal than buying an actual dvd player at the time.
            However there was a short-lived version of the Gamecube called <cite>Panasonic Q</cite>. It was exclusive only in Japan but disconnected within two years 
            due to poor sales. It is now seen as a rare item for collectors.
